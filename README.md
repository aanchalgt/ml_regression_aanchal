# Insurance Charges Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an insurance dataset to predict individual insurance charges based on features like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. We explore the data, preprocess it, train regression models, and compare their performance to select the best model for predicting insurance costs.

# Peer Review – Regression Notebook

**Notebook Reviewed:** [regression_moses.ipynb](https://github.com/mokeyzz1/ml_regression_moses/blob/main/regression_moses.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization
- The notebook is well-structured and easy to follow.  
- Markdown explanations make it simple to understand each step.  
- Visualizations help to quickly grasp data patterns and results.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
- The chosen features make sense for predicting the target variable.  
- Both numeric and categorical features are used correctly, and categorical encoding is done properly.  
- Could explain more clearly *why* these features were selected based on data exploration.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
- Multiple models are trained and evaluated with metrics like R², MAE, and RMSE.  
- Results are easy to compare, and plots of predicted vs actual values help interpret performance.  
- Using cross-validation could give more reliable performance estimates.

## 4. Reflection Quality
- Reflections on model performance and limitations are included.  
- Could add more insight on *why* some models perform better or worse.  
- Next steps and suggestions for improvement could be included, such as feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- Check and handle outliers or skewed features explicitly.  
- Add feature engineering like interaction terms or polynomial features.  
- Include feature importance to see which features contribute most to predictions.  
- Expand reflections to explain reasoning and future steps in more detail.
